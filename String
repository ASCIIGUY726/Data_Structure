Small set of elements. Unlike normal array, strings typically have smaller set of items. For example, lowercase English alphabet has only 26 characters. ASCII has only 256 characters.
Strings are immutable in programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript and C#.
In Java, a String is the type of object that can store a sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes and every character is stored in 16 bits, i.e., using UTF 16-bit encoding. A string acts the same as an array of characters. Java provides a robust and flexible API for handling strings, allowing for various operations such as concatenation, comparison and manipulation.

Example:
public class HFT {

    // Main Function
    public static void main(String args[])
    {

        // creating Java string using a new keyword
        String str = new String("Geeks");

        System.out.println(str);
    }
}
